# Example Hermes configuration file

### Define properties of the storage devices
devices:
  nvme:
    mount_point: "${HOME}/test"
    capacity: 100GB
    block_size: 4KB
    slab_sizes: [ 4KB, 16KB, 64KB, 1MB ]
    bandwidth: 1GBps
    latency: 600us
    is_shared_device: false
    borg_capacity_thresh: [ 0.0, 1.0 ]

### Define properties of RPCs
rpc:
  # A path to a file containing a list of server names, 1 per line. If your
  # servers are named according to a pattern (e.g., server-1, server-2, etc.),
  # prefer the `rpc_server_base_name` and `rpc_host_number_range` options. If this
  # option is not empty, it will override anything in `rpc_server_base_name`.
  host_file: ""

  # Host names are constructed as "base_name +
  # host_number + rpc_server_suffix." Each entry in the rpc_host_number_range_list
  # can be either a single number, or a range, which is 2 numbers separated by a
  # hyphen (-). For example the list {01, 03-05, 07, 08-10} will be expanded to
  # {01, 03, 04, 05, 07, 08, 09, 10}.
  host_names: ["localhost"]

  # The RPC protocol. This must come from the documentation of the specific RPC
  # library in use.
  protocol: "ofi+sockets"

  # RPC domain name for verbs transport. Blank for tcp.
  domain: ""

  # Desired RPC port number.
  port: 8080

  # The number of handler threads for each RPC server.
  num_threads: 4

### Define properties of the BORG
buffer_organizer:
  # The number of threads used in the background organization of internal Hermes buffers.
  num_threads: 4

  # Desired RPC port number for buffer organizer.
  port: 8081

### Define the default data placement policy
dpe:
  # Choose Random, RoundRobin, or MinimizeIoTime
  default_placement_policy: "MinimizeIoTime"

  # If true (1) the RoundRobin placement policy algorithm will split each Blob
  # into a random number of smaller Blobs.
  default_rr_split: 0

# The shared memory prefix for the hermes shared memory segment. A user name
# will be automatically appended.
shmem_name: "/hermes_shm_"

# The interval in milliseconds at which to update the global system view.
system_view_state_update_interval_ms: 1000
